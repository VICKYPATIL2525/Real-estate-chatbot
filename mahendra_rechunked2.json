    "text": "Mahindra Happinest Palghar 2: 1 & 2 BHK Flats for Sale in Palghar\nHow Does Our EMI Calculator Work?Our EMI calculator simplifies complex financial calculations into a few easy steps.All you need to do is input three basic details:\nPrincipal Loan Amount (P): This is the total amount of money you wish to borrow from the bank or financial institution.Interest Rate (R): This is the annual interest rate charged by the lender on your loan.Loan Tenure (N): This is the total duration, in months or years, over which you plan to repay your loan.Once you enter these values, our calculator instantly computes your monthly EMI using the following formula:\nEMI = P × R × (1 + R)^N / ((1 + R)^N – 1)\nWhere\nP = Principal Loan Amount\nR = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate / 12 / 100)\nN = Loan Tenure in Months\nIn addition to above, you have to have a detailed understanding of your monthly financial obligations like expenses towards ongoing loans or credit card EMIs, so you get a clear picture if your financial health is capable of take care of the new loan obligation.Why Use a Home Loan EMI Calculator?Better Financial Planning: Understand your monthly outflow and compare different loan scenarios (e.g., varying loan amounts, tenures, or interest rates) to find what best suits your financial capacity.Transparency: Clearly see the breakdown of your principal and interest components over time.Save Time: No need for manual calculations or complex spreadsheets.An EMI calculator tool does the work for you.Informed Decision Making: Empower yourself with the knowledge needed to choose the right home loan product.What is an EMI?EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment.It is a fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each month.It consists of both the principal loan amount and the interest accrued on the outstanding loan balance.Over the loan tenure, the interest component is higher in the initial EMIs and gradually decreases, while the principal component increases.Key Components of Your Home Loan EMI:\nPrincipal Amount: The actual amount of money you borrowed from the bank.Interest Amount: The cost of borrowing money calculated based on the interest rate and the outstanding principal.Pre-EMI vs EMI: What’s the Difference?When a home loan is disbursed in parts often during property construction, borrowers usually pay Pre-EMI, which includes only the interest on the loan amount released so far.",

    "text": "How to Reduce Your Overall Interest and Loan Tenure?If you want to save on interest and close your loan faster, here are some simple strategies:\nOpt for a shorter tenure: While EMIs will be slightly higher, you’ll pay significantly less interest over time.Make part-prepayments: Whenever possible, pay a lump sum towards the principal.This reduces the outstanding balance and future interest burden.Refinance to a lower rate: If another bank offers a better rate, consider transferring your home loan to reduce both interest and tenure.Increase EMI amount: Even a small top-up in your monthly EMI can shorten your tenure and reduce total interest outgo.These steps can help you manage your home loan EMI smartly and save considerably in the long run.Benefits of Using a Home Loan EMI Calculator\nBudgeting: Helps you allocate your monthly income to accommodate the EMI without stressing your finances.Comparison: Allows you to compare different loan offers from various lenders by inputting their respective interest rates and tenures.Prepayment Planning: While not directly calculating prepayment, understanding your EMI helps you see how much extra you might need to pay to reduce your principal faster.Stress-Free Planning: Takes the guesswork out of home loan repayment, allowing you to focus on choosing your perfect home with Mahindra Lifespaces.How to Maximize Your Savings on a Home Loan?Opt for a Shorter Tenure: If your finances allow, a shorter tenure means less interest paid overall.Make Prepayments: Any additional payments made towards the principal can significantly reduce your total interest burden and shorten your loan tenure.Look for Lower Interest Rates: Always compare offers from multiple lenders.Even a 0.25% difference can save you lakhs over decades.Maintain a Good Credit Score: A high credit score can help you negotiate for better interest rates.Mahindra Lifespaces: Helping You Plan Your Home Loan with Confidence\nAt Mahindra Lifespaces, we understand that buying a home is one of life’s most important financial and emotional decisions.That’s why our goal is to make every step from planning your finances to finding the perfect property seamless, transparent, and stress-free.Since 2013, we have maintained a 100% green portfolio, ensuring all our products are certified as green.Notably, three of our projects have achieved the highest levels of green certification under the IGBC and GRIHA rating systems.",

    "text": "If you opt for a fixed interest rate loan, your EMI will remain constant.However, for floating interest rate loans, your EMI may change if the benchmark interest rate changes, leading to an adjustment in your lender's interest rate.What happens if I make a partial prepayment?Making a partial prepayment reduces your outstanding principal loan amount.This typically gives you two options: either reduce your future EMIs or keep the EMI same and reduce your loan tenure.Most financial advisors recommend reducing the tenure to save more on interest.Can I change my loan tenure after taking the loan?Yes, most banks allow you to negotiate changes to your loan tenure, especially when interest rates change or if you make significant prepayments.However, this is subject to the bank's policies and may involve some processing fees.Disclaimer: This blog provides general information and should not be considered legal or financial advice.Always seek professional guidance for property-specific or tax-related queries.",

    "text": "What is the ideal loan tenure?The ideal loan tenure depends on your financial capacity, age, and future income expectations.While a longer tenure offers lower EMIs, a shorter tenure saves on overall interest.It's a balance between affordability and total cost.Our calculator helps you visualize these scenarios.How is the monthly interest rate calculated from the annual interest rate for EMI?The annual interest rate (e.g., 8% per annum) is first divided by 100 to convert it into a decimal (0.08).Then, this decimal rate is divided by 12 to get the monthly interest rate.So, if the annual rate is 8%, the monthly rate (R in the formula) would be 0.08 / 12 = 0.00667.Disclaimer: This blog provides general information and should not be considered legal or financial advice.Always seek professional guidance for property-specific or tax-related queries.Can I get a home loan EMI without a down payment?Getting a home loan without any down payment is generally not possible, as most lenders require the borrower to contribute a portion of the property value upfront.The down payment demonstrates financial commitment and reduces the overall loan amount.A higher down payment can also help lower your home loan EMI and total interest cost.What is the impact of a rising interest rate on my floating home loan EMI?For a floating-rate home loan, if interest rates rise, your lender typically has two options:\nIncrease your EMI: Your monthly payment goes up to accommodate the higher interest cost while keeping the tenure same.Increase your loan tenure: Your EMI remains the same, but the number of remaining installments (tenure) increases to cover the higher interest.Most banks initially prefer to increase tenure.Our calculator helps you understand such scenarios by adjusting the interest rate.How do I calculate the total interest paid over the entire home loan tenure?Our EMI calculator automatically provides the total interest payable.Manually, once you have the monthly EMI, you multiply it by the total number of months in your loan tenure (EMI x N).From this total amount, you subtract the principal loan amount (P).The remaining figure is the total interest paid.Total Interest = (EMI x Loan Tenure in Months) - Principal Loan Amount\nDisclaimer: This blog provides general information and should not be considered legal or financial advice.Always seek professional guidance for property-specific or tax-related queries.What documents are typically required when applying for a home loan?",

    "text": "A lower interest rate directly translates to a lower monthly EMI and reduced overall interest payable.Is it better to pay a higher EMI or opt for a longer tenure?This depends on your financial comfort and goals.a) Higher EMI: If you can comfortably afford it, a higher EMI (leading to a shorter tenure) will result in substantial savings on the total interest paid over the life of the loan.b) Longer Tenure: If you need to keep your monthly cash outflow low, a longer tenure provides a more affordable EMI.However, be aware that you will pay significantly more interest over the loan period.Our calculator can help you compare these scenarios.What is the difference between fixed and floating interest rates for home loans?a) Fixed Interest Rate: The interest rate remains constant throughout the loan tenure, providing predictable EMIs.This offers stability but might be higher than floating rates if market rates fall.b) Floating Interest Rate: The interest rate changes periodically based on market benchmarks (like Repo Rate).Your EMI can fluctuate (or tenure can change).While it offers the benefit of lower EMIs if rates fall, it also carries the risk of higher EMIs if rates rise.How does a home loan balance transfer impact my EMI?A home loan balance transfer involves moving your existing home loan from one lender to another, usually to get a lower interest rate.If you secure a lower interest rate, your EMI will likely decrease, or you might choose to keep the EMI same and reduce your remaining loan tenure, saving you money on interest in the long run.Disclaimer: This blog provides general information and should not be considered legal or financial advice.Always seek professional guidance for property-specific or tax-related queries.How can I reduce my current ROI if my current ROI is higher than the new home loan ROI offering?Negotiating with your existing lender, especially if you have a strong payment history.Pay the switch fee and get your high running ROI to the prevailing current ROI.The new ROI will still be a few base points higher than the new offering.Disclaimer: This blog provides general information and should not be considered legal or financial advice.Always seek professional guidance for property-specific or tax-related queries.Can I avail top up loan on my current home loan for renovation/ home furnishing?Yes, a top-up loan is an additional loan amount that your lender may offer over and above your existing home loan.",

    "text": "Understanding GST in Real Estate: Applicability, Rates, and Implications\nGST Rates on Under-Construction and OC-Received Properties: A Comprehensive Guide\nThe introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has significantly restructured India’s tax landscape, especially within the real estate sector.For both developers and property buyers, understanding how GST applies to under-construction and OC (Occupancy Certificate)-received properties is crucial.GST in the real estate sector of India has helped home buyers, investors, and developers clearly understand how GST affects property purchase, sale, and construction costs.In this blog, we’ll explain in detail the applicability, rates, and implications of GST on real estate transactions — covering both residential and commercial properties — to help you make better-informed property decisions.What is GST (Goods and Services Tax) in Real Estate?GST is a unified indirect tax imposed on the supply of goods and services, which includes certain real estate transactions.It was introduced to simplify the previously complicated tax structure that included multiple indirect taxes like VAT, service tax, and excise duty.By replacing these with a single tax framework, GST has made the taxation process more transparent and streamlined across India.In the context of real estate, GST applies to transactions involving under-construction flats, residential apartments, and commercial properties, ensuring a uniform tax rate across the country.Applicability of GST in Property Transactions\nGST applies differently depending on whether a property is under construction or already completed.Applicable: Under-construction properties or those that have not yet received an Occupancy Certificate (OC).Not Applicable: Completed or resale properties that already have an OC.This means GST is mainly relevant during the construction phase and not after the property is deemed complete by the concerned authority.Therefore, when buyers search for properties, it’s important to know whether the property is under construction or has an occupancy certificate, as GST applicability directly depends on this factor.Difference in GST Applicability: Under-Construction vs OC-Received Properties\nUnder-Construction Properties: GST is levied on the total sale consideration, excluding stamp duty and registration charges.This makes the tax applicable to the base property cost.",

Non-Affordable Housing in RREP: GST Rate: 5% (without Input Tax Credit), payable in cash by the developer.2.Commercial Properties in REP\nGST Rate: 18% with a one-third deduction for land value, making the effective rate 12% on the total consideration.Developers of such projects are eligible to claim Input Tax Credit (ITC) on GST paid for inputs, input services, and capital goods.Example of GST Calculation\nAffordable Housing:\nFor a flat priced at ₹30,00,000\n→ GST = 1% × 30,00,000 = ₹30,000\nNon-Affordable Housing:\nFor a property priced at ₹80,00,000\n→ GST = 5% × 80,00,000 = ₹4,00,000\nThese GST calculations play a crucial role for anyone planning to buy an apartment during the construction stage, as GST on new flats directly influences the final property price.GST on OC-Received Properties\na.Why GST is Not Applicable on OC-Received Properties:\nAs per GST law, once a property receives an Occupancy Certificate, it is no longer considered a “supply of goods or services.” Therefore, GST does not apply to such transactions.Many buyers prefer OC-received or ready-to-move properties to avoid paying GST, which makes understanding the difference between GST on under-construction and ready-to-move properties vital.b.Impact on Buyers:\nFor OC-received properties, buyers only pay stamp duty and registration charges, which reduces the overall cost of acquisition.Components of GST on Under-Construction Properties\nGST is not levied on the full property price.Instead, it is applied only to the construction cost, after deducting the notional value of the land.Land Value Deduction: One-third (1/3rd) of the total property value is considered the land cost and excluded from GST calculations.",

Impact of ITC Removal:\nWithout ITC, developers must absorb the GST cost on their inputs, which increases their overall cost.Consequently, property prices for under-construction homes have seen a slight rise.",

    "text": "Comprehensive Guide to Renting Out Immovable Property in India\nRenting out immovable property—whether residential, commercial, or industrial—is a well-established practice in the Indian real estate sector.However, this process involves several legal, financial, and tax considerations that both landlords and tenants must clearly understand to ensure seamless and compliant transactions.This comprehensive guide explores the process, obligations, and challenges involved in renting out property in India while highlighting the key legal and tax aspects every property owner and tenant should be aware of.What Does Renting Out Immovable Property Mean?Renting refers to the act of leasing out a property to a tenant in exchange for periodic rent payments.The arrangement can involve various categories of properties depending on the intended use and type of occupants.The primary types of properties that can be rented include:\nResidential Properties: Flats, independent houses, or villas leased to individuals or families for dwelling purposes.Commercial Properties: Shops, office spaces, or co-working spaces used for business and professional activities.Industrial Properties: Warehouses, factories, or industrial units used for manufacturing or storage purposes.Understanding these distinctions is crucial, as each category involves different legal frameworks, taxation rules, and compliance requirements.Having proper knowledge of rental agreements, tenant rights, tax liabilities, and applicable state laws helps both landlords and tenants maintain transparency and avoid potential disputes.It ensures compliance with statutory obligations, protects financial interests, and contributes to smoother rental transactions.Types of Rental Agreements\n1) Residential Lease Agreement\nFeatures: Typically short-term in nature, usually lasting for 11 months, which helps landlords avoid the complex provisions of long-term tenancy laws.Terms: The agreement includes details such as rent amount, security deposit, maintenance charges, renewal conditions, and notice period.2) Commercial Lease Agreement\nDifferences from Residential Leases: Usually has a longer tenure and includes specific clauses tailored for business operations.It may require higher security deposits and contains detailed conditions related to usage and maintenance.Clauses: Provisions for subletting, signage rights, alterations, and commercial usage terms are commonly included to ensure business continuity.",

    "text": "A strong credit score (generally above 750-800) indicates to lenders that you are a responsible borrower.This significantly increases your chances of loan approval and often qualifies you for more favorable terms, including a lower interest rate.A lower interest rate directly translates to a lower monthly EMI and reduced overall interest payable.Is it better to pay a higher EMI or opt for a longer tenure?This depends on your financial comfort and goals.a) Higher EMI: If you can comfortably afford it, a higher EMI (leading to a shorter tenure) will result in substantial savings on the total interest paid over the life of the loan.b) Longer Tenure: If you need to keep your monthly cash outflow low, a longer tenure provides a more affordable EMI.However, be aware that you will pay significantly more interest over the loan period.Our calculator can help you compare these scenarios.What is the difference between fixed and floating interest rates for home loans?a) Fixed Interest Rate: The interest rate remains constant throughout the loan tenure, providing predictable EMIs.This offers stability but might be higher than floating rates if market rates fall.b) Floating Interest Rate: The interest rate changes periodically based on market benchmarks (like Repo Rate).Your EMI can fluctuate (or tenure can change).While it offers the benefit of lower EMIs if rates fall, it also carries the risk of higher EMIs if rates rise.How does a home loan balance transfer impact my EMI?A home loan balance transfer involves moving your existing home loan from one lender to another, usually to get a lower interest rate.If you secure a lower interest rate, your EMI will likely decrease, or you might choose to keep the EMI same and reduce your remaining loan tenure, saving you money on interest in the long run.Disclaimer: This blog provides general information and should not be considered legal or financial advice.Always seek professional guidance for property-specific or tax-related queries.How can I reduce my current ROI if my current ROI is higher than the new home loan ROI offering?Negotiating with your existing lender, especially if you have a strong payment history.Pay the switch fee and get your high running ROI to the prevailing current ROI.The new ROI will still be a few base points higher than the new offering.Disclaimer: This blog provides general information and should not be considered legal or financial advice.",

In India, now most RCC framed buildings are built as per local bylaws, the National Building Code and relevant Indian Standard codes that are considered safe to withstand earthquake forces. As India is divided into various seismic zones, it is important for builders and authorities to ensure that the design complies with the relevant IS standards. There are specialized green building certification bodies like the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC), Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA), etc. which certify a building to be a sustainable/green development. A green-certified building is one that, by its design, construction, or operation, reduces or eliminates negative impacts on our climate and natural environment. Every green building in India is carefully designed to protect valuable natural resources while also improving the quality of life of the residents.

    "text": "Tax Benefits for NRIs on Home Loans in India\nNRIs can avail of tax benefits on home loans by filing the income tax return in India under Section 139 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.A tax deduction is offered on the principal component under Section 80C up of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to a maximum limit of Rs.1,50,000 per annum and the interest component of the loan under Section 24 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 up to a maximum limit of Rs.2,00,000 per annum.If the home for which the home loan has been procured is left vacant in India, one can avail of the tax benefits under Section 80C and 24 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 on their home loans.*The above tax benefit for the Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 will only be applicable if the assessee has taxable income in India and files the ‘Income tax return’ in India within the due date specified under the income tax act of India.On the other hand, if the home is on rent, one can claim the complete interest payable component as a tax deduction on their home loan.Home Loan Period\nThe tenure for which the resident of India can take home loans differs from that of an NRI.For example, a resident of India can take up to 30 years to return the amount lent, while an NRI may take up to 20 years.(All these are general information which can vary from bank to bank as per their discretion)\nInterest Rate for NRI Home Loans\nThe home loan interest rate for NRIs varies with the financial institution from which it is taken.Interest rates for NRIs are generally higher than those for Indian residents due to the higher risk factor.Income Requirements\nNRIs must have a minimum salary of INR 2,00,000 per annum to benefit from a home loan.Points to Remember While Buying Property in India\nSale of Property\nThe sale of up to two properties may be repatriated, but only if the acquisition was made using an NRE account and not in any other circumstance.The amount repatriated must match the amount paid for the immovable property in foreign currency received through traditional banking methods, from money kept in FCNR or NRE Accounts, or both.",

    "text": "A home loan interest rate calculator helps you estimate the total interest payable on your loan based on your loan amount, tenure, and applicable interest rate.It quickly shows how different rates affect your EMI, helping you compare and choose the best option.How accurate is a home loan interest rate calculator?A home loan interest rate calculator provides highly reliable estimates based on standard EMI formulas.While actual figures may vary slightly due to processing fees or rate changes, it gives a close and dependable idea for financial planning.How do I understand my home loan repayment structure?Your home loan repayment schedule consists of both principal and interest components.Initially, a larger portion goes toward interest, but over time, the principal share increases.Our EMI calculator also shows this breakdown clearly through an amortization schedule.Can I claim tax benefits on my home loan EMI payments?Yes.Under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, you can claim tax deductions on the principal repaid.Additionally, under Section 24(b), you can claim deductions on the interest component of your EMI, making your monthly home loan payments more tax-efficient.Disclaimer: This blog provides general information and should not be considered legal or financial advice.Always seek professional guidance for property-specific or tax-related queries.How much EMI can I afford for my income?Use our home loan EMI calculator online to determine an EMI amount that fits comfortably within your budget and ensures stress-free repayments.Is the EMI fixed throughout the loan tenure?If you opt for a fixed interest rate loan, your EMI will remain constant.However, for floating interest rate loans, your EMI may change if the benchmark interest rate changes, leading to an adjustment in your lender's interest rate.What happens if I make a partial prepayment?Making a partial prepayment reduces your outstanding principal loan amount.This typically gives you two options: either reduce your future EMIs or keep the EMI same and reduce your loan tenure.Most financial advisors recommend reducing the tenure to save more on interest.Can I change my loan tenure after taking the loan?Yes, most banks allow you to negotiate changes to your loan tenure, especially when interest rates change or if you make significant prepayments.However, this is subject to the bank's policies and may involve some processing fees.",

    "text": "Can I get a home loan EMI without a down payment?Getting a home loan without any down payment is generally not possible, as most lenders require the borrower to contribute a portion of the property value upfront.The down payment demonstrates financial commitment and reduces the overall loan amount.A higher down payment can also help lower your home loan EMI and total interest cost.What is the impact of a rising interest rate on my floating home loan EMI?For a floating-rate home loan, if interest rates rise, your lender typically has two options:\n1.Increase your EMI: Your monthly payment goes up to accommodate the higher interest cost while keeping the tenure same.2.Increase your loan tenure: Your EMI remains the same, but the number of remaining installments (tenure) increases to cover the higher interest.Most banks initially prefer to increase tenure.Our calculator helps you understand such scenarios by adjusting the interest rate.How do I calculate the total interest paid over the entire home loan tenure?Our EMI calculator automatically provides the total interest payable.Manually, once you have the monthly EMI, you multiply it by the total number of months in your loan tenure (EMI x N).From this total amount, you subtract the principal loan amount (P).The remaining figure is the total interest paid.Total Interest = (EMI x Loan Tenure in Months) - Principal Loan Amount\nDisclaimer: This blog provides general information and should not be considered legal or financial advice.Always seek professional guidance for property-specific or tax-related queries.What documents are typically required when applying for a home loan?While specific requirements vary by lender, common documents for buying a home include:\n- Identity Proof: PAN card, Aadhaar card, Passport, Voter ID.- Address Proof: Aadhaar card, Passport, Utility bills (electricity, water).- Income Proof (Salaried): Latest salary slips (3-6 months), Bank statements (6 months), Form 16, ITR.- Income Proof (Self-Employed): Business profile, ITRs (2-3 years), P&L statement, Balance sheet, Bank statements (1 year).- Property Documents: Agreement to Sell, Allotment Letter, Chain of Title deeds, NOC from builder, etc.It's always best to check with your specific lender for an exact list.Can a higher credit score help in getting a lower home loan EMI?Absolutely.A strong credit score (generally above 750-800) indicates to lenders that you are a responsible borrower.",

    "text": "Here are 5 Top Reasons to Invest in Property In Kalyan\nThe Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority or MMRDA had gauged the potential of Kalyan for being the growth centre of micro-markets.The city was anticipated to be an industrial hub due to its proximity to Bhiwandi, the largest logistics hub.Kalyan’s integrated transport system and a multitude of social infrastructural amenities make it an ideal residential as well as a commercial solution for the middle-income group.Let’s have a look at the Top 5 Reasons why Kalyan is considered as a Real Estate Hotspot.1.Infrastructure for Connectivity\nThe inclusion of Kalyan-Dombivli in the Smart City Mission has triggered the unending growth of infrastructure and transportation in the city.The inception and making of the Bhiwandi-Kalyan Corridor will surely provide the best connectivity solution for Kalyan.The construction of the 24.9 km long Metro Line 5 which will connect 17 stations, including Kalyan to Thane is expected to be operational by 2022.Along with it, Virar-Alibaug 8 lane Modal Corridor is also in the making, which will also be operational during the same time.2.Pocket-Friendly Housing Solutions\nWith quick price comparison, one can easily understand the value of real estate property in Kalyan.A 1 BHK (300 sq.ft to 392 sq.ft) in Thane or Khadakpada will cost you approximately ₹50 Lakhs, but a 2 BHK in Kalyan (650 sq.ft) can be easily offered in the same price range.This difference is due to the increased travel time to reach the city centre, which will significantly reduce, once the above-mentioned infrastructure is in place.3.Employment Opportunities with Market Expansion\nThe area in and around Bhiwandi and Kalyan is proving to be a huge warehousing and logistics market for big brands.Over the years, many MNCs have shifted their base from the Central Business Districts (CBDs) in Mumbai to areas like Thane, Kalyan-Bhiwandi and Navi Mumbai.Better land availability, lower property rates and improving connectivity is bringing in large organizations to Kalyan which is set to create a large number of employment opportunities.4.Better Social Infrastructure\nWith many reasons to choose a property in Kalyan, another major perk of living in the area is the already developed and upcoming social infrastructures like schools, colleges, malls, sports complexes, and recreational areas.",

    "text": "5 Interior Design Aspects Keep in Mind When Buying a Home\nWhen buying a home, one of the most important factors to consider is the interior design aspects of apartments.Elements of interior design are now all the more critical, given how the Covid pandemic has resulted in longer stretches of working from home.1.Seek more than just ‘space’\nWell-designed homes will not just offer space.Instead, such homes provide spaces that are thoughtfully designed and inherently flexible.With work-from-home now widely accepted and likely to remain a norm for some time, the need for quiet and private spaces within the home has increased.Many office tasks are now being performed at home.Consequently, it is worthwhile to evaluate prospective homes from this perspective.Ask yourself the question – ‘Is the apartment designed well enough so that I can, if required, turn existing corners and areas into personal workspaces?’\n2.Multifunctional rooms\nMulti-functional spaces within rooms (which in turn can serve as a self-sufficient ‘microcosm’ of the home) are expected to be the way forward.Ideally, each room must be able to fulfill the different needs of users throughout the day – from rest to rejuvenation and fitness to work.For example, the kitchen can also serve as a workplace, when not used for cooking and the parlour can double-up as an indoor workout area or meditation zone.3.Ergonomics\nErgonomics is important because when you’re doing a job, an awkward posture, extreme temperature, or repeated movement can impact your concentration and productivity and ultimately, the quality of output.Simple things, like having a plug point for your coffee kettle next to your desk, or being able to conveniently stack up your files on a desk and have space for a snack, are essential attributes to consider when evaluating the interiors of a new home.Your interior design ideas and plans will thus need to consider your ergonomics needs and that of your family.This is especially important in the case of senior citizens or differently-abled users.4.Adequate ventilation and daylight\nOptimal window-wall ratio ensures maximum ventilation and daylight while avoiding the discomfort of glare.All smart spaces and rooms should be designed in such a way so as to allow the outside in, in a pleasant manner at one with nature.5.Storage\nProvisions for smartly designed storage space is integral to good interior design ideas and interventions.",

    "text": "5 Property Laws You Should Know Before Buying A Home\nBuying a home is not as complicated as it’s made out to be and all the main laws that you need to know while buying a home are demystified in this article.The first step towards purchasing a property is to understand that all project details are available on the website of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority of the state under the Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016 (RERA).Information regarding the title, amenities and possession timelines of the project are available on this website, together with details of building construction progress, clubhouse, etc.as updated by the developer.RERA ensures that your payments to your developer are in the escrow account monitored by the Authority and that the developer is permitted to withdraw from this account only upon providing proof of construction and use of the amounts by submission of an architect, engineer and CA certificate.In case of any delay, the developer is required to pay compensation per RERA guidelines.Alternatively, you can withdraw your booking and seek refund with compensation.Also, once the plans for the property are approved by the authority, the developer cannot amend it without two-third consent of all the homebuyers in the project.After you have selected the property, you should seek execution and registration of the agreement for sale for the property by paying stamp duty as per the Indian Stamp Act/as per the State laws and registration fees as per the Registration Act.This is the title document for your property.Instead of a sale, you could also consider a lease, exchange or gift of a property as per The Transfer of Property Act.You must ensure that the payment of consideration for the property is being made by the person in whose name the agreement/sale deed is being registered so that there is no violation under The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016.Benami transactions are when a person’s own name is not used and instead, the name of another person or a fictitious person is used to purchase a property; or where the owner of the property has no knowledge of his/her ownership; or where the person paying the consideration is untraceable.",

Therefore, it is important to not get carried away and take a rationale, well-informed decision. Below are some of the questions one should ask to self before buying a property.\nWhat is your exact budget?\nIt’s important to know how much one wants to spend to buy a house.

There are other charges like club membership, parking, taxes paid to the government in the form of stamp duty and registration etc. These charges increase the over cost of the property.\nCan you afford lavish amenities?\nProjects come with an array of lavish amenities like temperature-controlled swimming pool, elevated jogging track, state-of-the-art gymnasium, club house etc. Consider the maintenance cost of these amenities that has to be paid once you get the possession of your flat. Before buying, ask yourself whether you and your family need those amenities in the first place.\nHow are you going to make the EMI payments?\nAs yourself, how are you going to make the EMI payments and whether you have backup for any contingency. Think about worst-case scenarios and whether you have a fallback option to make EMI payments.\nHave you checked the price of similar apartments?\nComparison has always been an important factor that facilitates decision-making. Make sure you check similarly-priced unit configurations that are provided by other developers in and around that area. Don’t forget to check their amenities and connectivity advantages as well.\nThese are some of the main questions which you should ask yourself before you decide to invest in a residential property.

    "text": "Understanding PMAY-Urban Initiative | Mahindra Lifespaces\nThe government of India, over the years, has implemented many housing schemes to cater to the diverse population.The primary objective of these schemes is to make sure everyone has a roof over their head and a home they can call their own.The parameters and criteria got drafted, taking into account the economic status of every household.In this regard, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana or PMAY housing scheme came into being in 2015.What is Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-U?Let’s understand what PMAY is, in the first place.Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) is a social welfare initiative by the Government of India aimed at providing affordable housing to the urban poor.The mission plans to achieve a target of building 20 million affordable houses by 31st March 2022, which also happens to be India’s 75th year of Independence.The initiative consists of 2 parts – PMAY-Urban for the urban poor and PMAY-Gramin for the rural poor.PMAY (U), therefore, addresses urban housing shortage among the Economically Weaker Section (EWS), Low Income Group (LIG), and Middle Income Group (MIG) categories, including the slum dwellers, by ensuring a well-built house to all the eligible urban families by 2022.PMAY (U) adopts a demand-driven approach wherein the housing shortage gets decided on the demand assessment by the states and union territories.The State Level Nodal Agencies (SLNAs), Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)/ Implementing Agencies (IAs), Central Nodal Agencies (CNAs), and Primary Lending Institutions (PLIs) are the main stakeholders.They play a vital role in the implementation and success of this scheme.Under current circumstances, the PM Awas Yojana 2020 has extended the interest subsidy on home loan amounts up to Rs.12 Lakh.Today, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban has successfully sanctioned around 1.03 Crore houses.Additionally, the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) for Middle Income Groups (MIG) recently extended its deadline for application till 31st March 2021.What is the Affordable Housing Scheme under PMAY?Indian cities are full of unsold properties that range from Rs.50 Lakh and upwards.On the other hand, the demand for affordable housing units is much higher than its supply, which unfortunately is worrisome for the less affluent who are looking to purchase a home in urban areas.The introduction of PMAY home loans up to Rs.",

The beneficiary family consists of husband, wife, unmarried sons, or unmarried daughters. To avoid duplicity, the beneficiary family members have to provide their Aadhaar Numbers while applying for the loan. Affordable housing has gained momentum in the past few years, with more real estate developers adding properties to this segment. However, availing of the benefits of the PMAY scheme needs careful assessment and evaluation, especially if you are a first-time homebuyer. Therefore, Mahindra Lifespaces suggests you understand the PMAY scheme in detail before applying for it, so you don’t miss out on any of these benefits that come along with it.",

    "text": "How Water Crisis Is Affecting Chennai's Real Estate Market\nSince the past year Chennai, one of India’s premier metro cities, has been hit by an acute water shortage.A weak monsoon in 2018 has resulted in one of the worst Chennai water crisis in many years.As citizens scurry to get even enough drinking water, it is natural that this water scarcity has hit a lot of segments that are water dependent.And one of the most important sectors to feel the severe pinch of this water crisis is Chennai Real Estate market.In fact, just as builders in Chennai were celebrating the revival of the real estate market after a slump of almost 5 years, the water disaster could not have hit them at a more inopportune time.Once again the real estate industry is feeling the heat and many builders have slowed down their operations.Some of the key factors that have led to this slowdown include\nPriority to drinking water needs\nAs Chennai faces a water crunch, the first priority for the government is to ensure that drinking water supply is adequate.The summer months have further dried up reservoirs, forcing the Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) to reduce piped water supply.Naturally, preference of water supply for other needs gets pushed down the list of priorities.This has resulted in industries, including the real estate segment, finding it difficult and costly to meet their water requirements.Depleting groundswell water resource\nIn addition to a poor monsoon in 2018, the harsh summer months this year has left the groundswell water levels seriously depleted.This has meant that the real estate industry, which is highly dependent on water supply for work completion, has had to procure water from other sources such as water tankers.Some builders in Chennai have started making future provisions by using innovative construction technologies that can help minimize water usage (Mahindra Lifespaces uses Gypsum plaster, an alternate material to cement sand plaster which requires 50 per cent less water for mixing and no water for curing).Other methods include constructing storm water collection and rain water harvesting systems which can increase the quality and yield of groundwater (but this is not an instant solution and will happen only in a couple years).",

    "text": "Sand Crisis\nAnother factor that has contributed to the slowdown to Chennai real estate sector is the sand crisis. Sand is an important component of construction but the curbs on local sand procurement’s due to illegal mining, rising prices of river bed sand etc. has meant that builders now have to rely on imported sand. The cost of sand is almost 10% of the total cost of construction and any rise in its cost will naturally drive up the construction cost as well as the final price of the properties. In fact, the combination of water scarcity and shortage of sand has resulted in hundreds of construction projects being stopped in Chennai. One reputed name in Chennai real estate market is Mahindra Lifespaces who have responded proactively to the water crisis by initiating a number of measures in their projects to save water such as including wastewater treatment plants to reduce potable water use, tertiary water treatment plant and rainwater harvesting to recharge groundwater. Currently, Mahindra Lifespaces has multiple projects in Chennai and home buyers can choose from Happinest Avadi which offers ready-to-move-in 1 & 2 BHK flats in Chennai, Aqualily, an exclusive gated community of elegant and well-designed 1 & 3 BHK apartments in Chengalpattu and Lakewoods that consists of 2 & 3 BHK ready-to-move-in flats in Chengalpattu.

    "text": "Impact of new GST rates on Real Estate\nIn recent months, the GST council addressed concerns related to builders’ inventory of under construction properties. Builders were given an option of either choosing the existing higher tax rate with input tax credit (ITC) or the new flat rate which took effect from April this year. The existing GST on under construction flats, as of March, was 12%. According to the new GST rate on real estate, the builder gets to choose whether to keep the existing tax rate and with ITC benefit OR accept the new rate of 5% without ITC benefit.\nHowever, effective 1 April, new projects will have to accept the new GST rates of 5%, and 1% on affordable projects. There is no ITC benefit available for them.\nEssentially, the builders can go for the most beneficial option to keep the liabilities low and tax credits intact. However, a condition was imposed that 80% procurement of raw materials and services by developers should be from registered dealers, to avail the new GST scheme. If the purchases done do not comply with these new norms, an 18 per cent tax would be levied upon the builder. Additionally, the tax on cement purchased from an unregistered dealer shall attract a tax of 28 per cent.\nIn the current market scenario, there is sufficient supply of ready to move homes. Customers benefit significantly by opting for projects with Occupancy Certificate. This minimizes completion/handover delays and Pre EMI-Interest costs. OC received projects do not attract GST which can result in further savings.\nNow is the perfect time to buy a premium home at Windchimes by Mahindra Lifespaces, Bangalore. The project has received OC and due for delivery by December 2019. The project is developed in prime location close to IIMB, Bannerghatta Road and offers spacious 3 & 4 BHKs.

    "text": "The Impact Of Affordable Housing Schemes On Homebuyers\nIn the Budget that was announced in 2017, affordable housing in India was granted infrastructural status.Since then until then recently presented Interim Budget 2019, the government has given due emphasis to affordable housing schemes and their beneficiaries.In these efforts, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) has played an instrumental role.The scheme underlines the objectives of providing housing across urban India and to subsidize the purchase of residential property for various economic segments.To make housing accessible to all, the government has devised two schemes to fund the interest of the borrowers in the urban areas.The first scheme, which pertains to interest rate subsidy, is applicable to the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) and the Low-Income Group (LIG).The other scheme is for the Middle-Income Group (MIG).PMAY has made it much easier for homebuyers to apply for and avail home loans at interest rate subsidies, thereby making housing accessible to various economic segments across urban India.Here are some ways in which PMAY has impacted homebuyers:\nInclusive eligibility criteria: The PMAY scheme offers a different set of eligibility criteria for various income groups, including the LIG, EWS, and the MIG, which is further segregated into two slabs—MIG I and MIG II.Depending on the annual income of the family, applicants are categorized into the aforementioned slabs.Apart from the criteria of annual income and property size, it is required that applicants do not previously own a pucca house in their name in any part of the country, or in the name of any of their immediate family members, as the idea behind the scheme is to provide housing for all.Subsidy disbursal: Under the PMAY scheme, prospective homeowners can apply for an interest rate subsidy.One of the greatest advantages that the scheme has offered homebuyers is that the subsidy is disbursed as soon as the application is approved, so as to provide upfront financial relief and reduce loan liability.No processing fee: Under the PMAY scheme, lenders are not allowed to charge the applicant a processing fee for the loan.The government takes it upon itself to compensate the lender for both the subsidy amount concession and processing fee that was not charged.However, for the cases in which the loan amount exceeds Rs.6 lakhs, then the lender can charge the regular processing fee.",

    "text": "Why Green Buildings Matter - Mahindra LifeSpaces\nWhen buying cars, mileage is top of mind for millions of consumers in vehicle showrooms and households across India.What is interesting though is how (and why) fuel consumption is a very important criterion while selecting a vehicle, but utilities (electricity and water) consumption is not even a consideration when investing in a home.In the case of a home, priorities in addition to ticket price include location; physical infrastructure; nearby social infrastructure; connectivity; developer’s reputation and prior track record; delivery of the project; amenities & open spaces; unit sizes and finishing options.The ratio of operating costs to initial product cost is relatively higher for a car vs. home or apartment, and so operating costs appear less important when buying a home.Though the relative amount as compared to automobile maintenance is lower, households still spend significantly on electricity, water and society maintenance (anywhere between INR 5000-25000 per month for a typical household, with all major appliances including ACs and operations & maintenance of outdoor lighting, lifts, common areas, etc.).Also, most home buyers have varying and limited understanding of what a ‘green’ rated home entails; and very few understand the benefits of owning a green home in simple, concrete terms.We may infer that this is a case of good intentions not yielding desired results due to lack of effective communication.Many developers and non-governmental organizations have worked to define and develop ‘green’ rated homes.These homes offer several benefits to the customers across the life cycle of the building.However, in most cases, the communication to the customer is technical and/or heavy on jargon – ‘double glazing units, sewage treatment plants, rainwater harvesting, composter etc.’\n“So, what?” This is often the (unarticulated) question on the customer’s mind.Why green buildings?The building sector is one of the most significant in terms of scale and environmental impact.Globally, buildings account for approximately 40% annual energy consumption and up to 30% of all energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.",

As incremental costs of building green homes decrease and with developers becoming increasingly customer-focused, the pricing difference between green homes and conventional ones could eventually be a thing of the past. Communities and individuals are today more conscious – socially and environmentally – and seek opportunities to make choices that are good for communities and the planet.

    "text": "Buying a home?How to choose the right payment plan?Purchasing a home is one of the most significant events for a buyer.The decision to buy your own house is a huge one to make as it involves large sums of money and as such must be made with a clear, rational mind, with total understanding and study of the processes and risks and a structured plan for payment.Once you have set a budget and made an initial selection of the property, then the process of how to fund your property, the best home loan options, the amount of loan your salary slip will make you eligible for, your monthly EMI calculator etc.all takes centre stage.With many home loan options from reputed housing loan companies available, acquiring the funds to buy that house has become easier than before with a lot more payment plans to choose from.So let’s take a look at the multiple payment plans a home buyer has and their pros and cons.Apart from the traditional down payment method, other payment plans include Possession Linked or Construction Linked Plan, and Time Linked Plan.Possession Linked or Construction Linked Plan\nThis is a payment plan where the buyer pays around 10% of the price as a booking amount.Then the remaining payment (certain percent each time) is made by the buyer to the builder in slabs as and when the construction progresses or at every stage of construction.This is one of the most popular payment options among buyers as it is not time linked and the payments have to be made only when the builder delivers a construction phase thus the onus is on the builder to complete the construction in the stipulated timeframe.The only downside to this payment option is that the buyer often ends up paying more interest to the lender (mostly it is the bank) as the time period is lengthy.Time Linked Plan\nNot the most popular plans among buyers, but less risky than the down payment plan, time linked plans require the home buyer to make payment in installments according to a set time frame decided by the builder, say pay 10% now, pay 20% in 2020, and pay 70% on possession.Generally builders offer a discount of 8-10 % on the basic cost of property if the buyer opts for this payment plan.As the buyer is bound to make payments as per the builders preset timetable, unlike a Possession linked plan, this payment plan does not put the onus on the builder to complete the construction in a time bound manner.Payment is, obviously, one of the prime worries for a home buyer.",

    "text": "Top 3 Reasons To Buy A Home In Nagpur\nToday, the Indian homebuyer is moving beyond the metro cities to invest in a residential property. The emerging cities in India are on the radar of the Indian homebuyer due to many reasons that include price and affordability, work opportunities, work-life balance, way of life and many more. One of the underlying reasons for them to venture outside the big cities and metros could be the saturation of the real estate market there. Contrary to this, many experts are of the opinion that rising economic activity in cities such as Nagpur has caught the eye of homebuyers and is driving them to invest in a home there.\nWith a wide variety of properties and flats for sale in Nagpur, the “Orange City” has become one of the major destinations to for residential investment. So, let’s take a look at the top reasons to buy a home in this city.\nGreat Infrastructure & Connectivity\nBeing in the geographical centre of India, and its proximity to Mumbai, the city of Nagpur enjoys great infrastructure and connectivity to the rest of Maharashtra as well as the adjoining states. The Nagpur-Mumbai super expressway is said to connect 14 districts in the state of Maharashtra to JNPT. Home to multiple medical and engineering colleges, Nagpur has already established itself as an education hub. Moreover, the city comes with great healthcare, entertainment, and commercial facilities that make up for sound infrastructure.\nEmployment Opportunities\nBeing one of the upcoming IT and industrial hubs in the country, the city offers huge scope for employment. With many IT companies and MNCs setting up shop in the city, it has given rise to a number of township projects and residential developments as well.\nSteady Return On Investment (ROI)\nThe emergence of the IT sector and improved social infrastructure has contributed significantly to Nagpur’s steady appreciation in the recent years as the city continues to grow into one of the prime destinations for residential as well as commercial real estate investment.\nThe number of 2 BHK and 3 BHK flats for sale in Nagpur have increased due to the surge in residential developments in the city.

    "text": "Benefits Of RERA That You Should Know Before Investing In Properties\nThe Real Estate Regulation and Development Act (RERA), 2016, has been in effect in India for the last couple of years, and it has been one of the most instrumental changes in recent times to bring about transparency and efficiency into the Indian real estate sector, and to protect the rights and interests of homebuyers.Whenever you look to purchase a home, it is important that you look for the builder’s RERA compliance as indicated by the project’s RERA registration number.RERA stands to benefit homebuyers in numerous ways, and every state in the country has its own variant of RERA that is tailored to the realty market of that region.Here are some ways in which RERA benefits homebuyers in India:\nQuality construction: To ensure quality construction, builders are mandated to register their projects under RERA, and hence meet the prescribed standards for construction.They are required to be transparent about the entire process—from construction materials used to the technology employed.RERA has also imposed on builders across the country a defect liability period of five years, assuring homebuyers of transparent and quality construction.Timely completion: The timely completion of construction projects has been greatly emphasized by RERA.Builders are required to state the possession date of the project, and in the event that they fail to meet the target of completion, they are required to adequately compensate the allottees for the delay.Trustworthy developers: RERA mandates builders to register their projects under the Act, and to make the RERA registration number of each project available to the public.This ensures that the unreliable developers are ousted from the market, and only the trustworthy ones are sustained in the market.In the case of minor addition/alteration to the property, builders are required to inform the homebuyer.For larger additions or alterations, the builder must have the consent of at least two-thirds of the allottees/investors.To transfer the majority rights of a project to a third party, the builder must have the consent of at least two-thirds of the allottees/investors.Formation of Residents’ Welfare Association is also mandated by the Act.Fair advertising: A project cannot be announced, advertised or launched by a builder, until and unless it has been registered under RERA.",

    "text": "Additionally, the project plan, details of layout, land title status, government approvals and sub-contractors, must be shared with the allottees.Moreover, RERA has brought in a great level of transparency by strictly defining the term carpet area and by enforcing builders to cite only this figure of a housing unit when advertising it.Carpet area has now been redefined as ‘the net usable floor area of an apartment, excluding the area covered by the external walls, areas under services shafts, exclusive balcony or verandah area and exclusive open terrace area, but includes the area covered by the internal partition walls of the apartment’.Prompt grievance redressal: This is another great advantage offered by RERA.If you have been looking to invest in properties in Pune, it is advisable that you acquaint yourself with the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA), which has been in effect since May 1, 2017.Maharashtra is the first state in India to initiate the conciliation mechanism under Section 32 (g) of RERA.Owing to this, aggrieved homebuyers can look forward to an early and amicable resolution of their disputes with their developers.RERA approved projects by Mahindra Lifespaces are an excellent choice for investment or residence.So if you are looking to invest in properties in and around Pune, try exploring 2 BHK and 3 BHK ready-to-move-in apartments at Antheia by Mahindra Lifespaces in Pimpri.",

    "text": "Boisar – bang for the buck | Mahindra Happinest\nIf you are thinking of investing in Boisar, this article lists the various reasons why this fast-growing industrial town is such an attractive housing destination today.The prevailing sentiment among those looking to buy homes in MMR (Mumbai Metropolitan Region) is that suburbs beyond Dahisar can be considered only if one is unable to afford property in Borivali.However, there are fundamental flaws to this reasoning.The cost and features of a home are only some of the factors under advisement.Let us evaluate the many reasons to invest in a property beyond Dahisar, especially a Boisar property:\nLarge tracts of land are still available in areas like Boisar; thus, there is significant scope for development.Both large scale residential and commercial construction is possible in Boisar; so, with the area growing fast in terms of built space, there is good potential for price appreciation.In fact, it is a classic case of investing in real estate at the right time, when the scope for returns is high.Renowned real estate developers such as Mahindra Lifespaces, have developed thoughtfully designed flats in Boisar.These homes offer modern amenities, together with the intuitive use of space and expansive community areas.Whether a 1 BHK flat in Boisar or a larger unit, buyers can be assured of well-designed, modern homes built to exacting standards.Mahindra Lifespaces’property in Boisar , its second ‘Happinest’ project in India, is a 1 RK, 1 BHK and 2 BHK housing project spread over 14.86 acres.More than 550 units have been handed over at Happinest Boisar, with 750+ units sold till date.Projects such as these continue to see demand from buyers who seek long-term value from investments in reliable real estate brands.Investing in a flat in Boisar can reap dividends for the future.Not only are prices for the best Boisar properties quite competitive, but the market has not yet reached its full potential .Boisar properties are set to appreciate owing to planned infrastructure development in the region.Of the 4 proposed stations to be constructed in Maharashtra for the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project, one will be in Boisar.With the bullet train passing via Boisar, real estate in the region is expected to get a major shot in the arm.Boisar also scores on the connectivity quotient.",

Here is how to get the best deal on a home in the city!\nThe decision to buy or own a property or home is possibly one of the most important ones we make in our lives. And there is much planning that goes into the home-buying process. Professional requirements, connectivity options and neighbourhood specifics play a vital role in narrowing down one’s place of residence.\nIt makes sense to verify market trends that a city has seen over the years, together with property options, before deciding on a project.\nSo if Bangalore is a potential choice, one should ascertain:\nWhat are the different types of residential properties in Bangalore that are currently up for sale?\nAre there enough job opportunities in and around the vicinity?\nWhat is the infrastructural growth of the area?\nIs one looking for flats in Bangalore or is there a preference for duplex homes or villas?\nIs the neighbourhood family-friendly?\nWhat are rental rates like?\nThese are some basic due-diligence aspects. Let’s explore a few more.\nMarket know-how:\nA thorough, unhurried market study is critical to evaluate projects and growth potential. Also, what are the current inventory levels in that area?\nIt is also important to evaluate mid-recent property price appreciation trends of any given locality. Other factors include social infrastructure such as educational institutions and healthcare and retail outlets; transport facilities; and future growth prospects of the area.\nThe early bird gets the worm!\nThis saying holds true when it comes to property buying. Optimal timing is a must to strike it right! Simple things such as getting a pre-approval on a bank loan can speed up the home buying process considerably. One can also look at properties that have been on the market for some time – the likelihood of offers or deals is higher on these.\nDetail, detail\nOne way to find great deals on a home, especially in metro cities such as Bangalore or Mumbai, is to keep looking out for what’s new in the market. Take into consideration a project’s offerings, etc. It is advisable to consider trustworthy real estate developers with a proven track record such as Mahindra Lifespaces, to ensure RERA compliances and all statutory approvals. Clear land titles, all paperwork in place and a robust mechanism to address any customer queries are positive signs.\nFollow the above-mentioned things and let your home-buying process be a smooth and joyful one!",

    "text": "Green building ecosystem | by Vaibhav Jambhekar\nNo challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change\n– President Barack Obama, State of the Union Address, 2015\nIn late 2015, representatives from 194 countries gathered in Paris for the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (or COP21 ).The signing of the Paris Agreement on climate change was hailed as a landmark deal that united a majority of nations around the world to commit to a better tomorrow.Among the key outcomes achieved was the commitment to keep global temperatures ‘well below’ 2.0 C above pre-industrial times and to ‘endeavour to limit’ them even more, to 1.5 C; to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil, and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100; and to review each country’s contribution to cutting emissions every five years..\nEvery country attending COP21 made a pledge to cut emissions.India, the fourth largest carbon-emitter in the world (accounting for 6% of total global emissions) agreed to reduce its carbon emissions intensity – emissions per unit of GDP – by 33-35% from 2005 levels, over 15 years.Similarly, China’s target is to reach peak CO2 emissions by 2030 at the latest.Such targets are necessary if we want to secure a better planet for future generations.However, having agreed to these targets, it is even more important to identify the right focus areas and actions that would help achieve them.While emissions from industrial activity and vehicular traffic are the more ‘visible’ and top-of-mind targets for most, there is yet another sector which can contribute significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions – the construction sector.Consider the estimates – globally, buildings account for approximately 40% of annual energy consumption and upto 30% of all energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Collectively, the building sector is responsible for about 40% of global resource use (including 12% of all fresh-water use) and produces up to 40% of solid waste.The sector also employs, on average, more than 10% of the workforce.",

Globally too, architects such as Sou Fujimoto, Wang Shu, Thomas Herzog and Tatiana Bilbao have focused on the use of traditional methods and indigenous materials for construction. The Living Architecture (LIAR) project, for example, is envisioned as an integral component of human dwelling, capable of extracting valuable resources from sunlight, waste water and air and in turn, generating oxygen, proteins and biomass through the manipulation of their interactions. Its aim is to transform our habitats from inert spaces into programmable sites. As we expand our built environment, we should increasingly move away from uni-functional structures to ones that are open, permeable and interact with nature. As with other sectors or industries, innovation in urban construction is likely to be increasingly technology-driven. However, we must always be cognizant of the one stakeholder at center of it all – the customer or end user. As the real estate and construction ecosystem makes the shift to greener development norms and practices buildings, it will be equally important to educate customers about the benefits– both to the environment in the form of lower emissions and to the customers via lower operating & maintenance costs!

    "text": "Five tips for first-time home buyers\nBuying a new home is an aspiration for all, and a great feeling too, but a plethora of options can initially be confusing.In this article, we list a few tips that can serve as a checklist to make the decision-making process easier.1.Draw up a budget that you can stick to!Many a time, we tend to approach the home buying process with unrealistic budgets and end up spending more than what we had initially planned for.Sometimes, a first-time home buyer is sure of the kind of home s/he wants but is unsure of the price range that s/he can afford.Our advice:\nBefore you set out to identify your dream home, it is essential to iron out a few basic questions – What is the real estate scene in India, or in the city/locality/neighborhood you are considering buying a home in?What is your budget?Will you be able to extend it if required?How will you do so?You can use online mortgage calculators, several of which are available, to plan better.Seek help from your bank and arrive at a figure that you are comfortable with before exploring home/residential project options.Your agent should help you understand your loan terms and conditions, initial deposit/payment required and the various services provided by the home loan provider.2.Be clear about the non-negotiables:\nBefore you seriously start looking out for a new home, consider some crucial aspects– the lifestyle you lead, your aspirations and values.This will help you classify various project parameters as either negotiable or non-negotiable – the location of the property, area, amenities, etc.Then you can go through your list and alter it as per your priorities\n3.Compare homes/apartments for pricing:\nThe home buyer must ideally compare prices before buying.Visit the property before you decide to move in.Get a sense of the vicinity around the property.Ask yourself if this is the vicinity you see yourself living in, in the long term, or is there something else that you are looking for?4.Closing costs:\nThe closing costs include payments done for overlooking the buyer-seller agreement and home appraiser.This has to be paid by the buyer.The realtor’s commission, on the other hand, is taken care of by the seller.(Phew!)Buying a property in India, especially in the metropolitan cities, requires extensive research and evaluation.",

    "text": "Five tips for first-time home buyers\nBuying a new home is an aspiration for all, and a great feeling too, but a plethora of options can initially be confusing.In this article, we list a few tips that can serve as a checklist to make the decision-making process easier.1.Draw up a budget that you can stick to!Many a time, we tend to approach the home buying process with unrealistic budgets, and end up spending more than what we had initially planned for.Sometimes, a first-time home buyer is sure of the kind of home s/he wants, but is unsure of the price range that s/he can afford.Our advice:\nBefore you set out to identify your dream home, it is essential to iron out a few basic questions – What is the real estate scene in India, or in the city/locality/neighbourhood you are considering buying a home in?What is your budget?Will you be able to extend it if required?How will you do so?You can use online mortgage calculators, several of which are available, to plan better.Seek help from your bank and arrive at a figure that you are comfortable with before exploring home/residential project options.Your agent should help you understand your loan terms and conditions, initial deposit/payment required and the various services provided by the home loan provider.2.Be clear about the non-negotiables:\nBefore you seriously start looking out for a new home, consider some crucial aspects– the lifestyle you lead, your aspirations and values.This will help you classify various project parameters as either negotiable or non-negotiable – the location of the property, area, amenities, etc.Then you can go through your list and alter it as per your priorities\n3.Compare homes/apartments for pricing:\nThe home buyer must ideally compare prices before buying.Visit the property before you decide to move in.Get a sense of the vicinity around the property.Ask yourself if this is the vicinity you see yourself living in, in the long term, or is there something else that you are looking for?4.Closing costs:\nThe closing costs include payments done for overlooking the buyer-seller agreement and home appraiser.This has to be paid by the buyer.The realtor’s commission, on the other hand, is taken care by the seller.(Phew!)Buying a property in India, especially in the metropolitan cities, requires extensive research and evaluation.",

    "text": "Why Should More People opt for Sustainable Homes in Bangalore?– Mahindra Lifespaces\nIn the last decade, climate change and its ramifications have captured the arena of public discourse and modern living.As the global carbon emission levels inch dangerously close to the irreversible threshold, the urgency to act within the interest of the planet and its future has become imperative.Measures are being taken to help the planet recover and restore some of its earlier stable conditions, by working in tandem with sustainability policies.Therefore, sustainable housing and lifestyle choices are crucial steps in that direction.Sustainable homes have grown from a hypothetical possibility to a reality within the last few years.New housing projects and smarter energy solutions have gradually made their way into architectural engineering and led to the creation of sustainable homes that are entirely self-reliant and efficient.The focus on sustainable housing solutions is due to rapid urbanization that threatens natural biodiversity.For example, a city like Bangalore is an example of rapid industrialization, where the green cover only remains on the fringes and pockets of the city.Therefore, investing in a sustainable home in Bangalore would be a great starting point for those who hope to reconnect with nature and contribute to building a healthier planet.Bangalore’s Population Outburst and Climate Crisis\nLike most metropolitan cities, the temperate landscape of Bangalore was initially surrounded by greenery, and settlements occupied only a few areas of the topography.As time progressed, the population soared by 1028% from Greater Bangalore and outwards since 1973.This increase in population caused people to industrialize the land, giving rise to housing, industrial workspaces, and more.As a result of which, the biodiversity of Bangalore slowly diminished over time, factoring for only 2.96% of the area in 2020.While innovation and growth are inevitable in metropolitan cities like Bangalore, the importance of having adequate green cover to combat the effects of urbanization is something that requires urgent attention.Population and urbanization contribute to a major percentage of the global carbon emission levels every year.Because industries and homes are mostly powered by non-renewable resources that emit copious amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, greener and cleaner alternatives have become a pressing need.",

Mahindra Eden project pays great attention to the aspect of waste management, as it composts 100% of wet waste onsite, promotes primary and secondary waste segregation on-site through the provision of a resource recovery centre, handling of hazardous and non-hazardous waste by authorized recyclers or waste handlers. This protects and saves the city from huge landfills that would have been created due to non-segregation & treatment of waste, and health impacts due to the same. Building Sustainable Communities: Metropolitan cities are synonymous with fast-paced living that requires mobility. Sustainable homes in Bangalore ensure building a healthier and sustainable community for the modern age that is not completely reliant on non-renewable, carbon-intensive resources. From accessible travel and amenities, Mahindra Eden builds sustainable communities and a value chain using sustainable materials at its very core. The prime goal of a sustainable home in Bangalore is to forge nature-positive living as a standard within the landscape of the metropolitan.

    "text": "Housing In Gurugram: How A Locale Can Change Your Outlook As A Homebuyer\nThe enduring mantra in the real estate business is ‘Location, Location, Location’.That’s how important the location of a property is as it determines it’s pricing, attractiveness to the customers as well as the ROI that a property is likely to give the buyer.Every home buyer dreams of having a house in a prime location but they certainly don’t come cheap.But the advantage as stated above is that they definitely offer a higher selling price and a higher rental income.As a long term investment plan, it makes more sense to have an average house in a prime location than a luxurious one in a mediocre location.As a homeowner it is easier to upgrade a house than upgrade a location.So if a decent property is up for sale in a prime location, make sure you don’t let it go.But what determines a prime location in terms of real estate?Here are some key factors that set a property high on the rung of the location ladder.Proximity to Central Areas\nThe place where a buyer chooses to live determines how much they pay for the home purchase.Obviously if the house is set in a prime area that is near to CBDs, affluent residential areas, social and lifestyle amenities such as hospitals, entertainment centers, schools, and other daily needs, it commands a prime price.Local Neighborhood\nThe actual neighborhood also plays an important role in making a location the desired one for home buyers.Quality housing, environmentally sound surroundings, good schools to name a few, will be factors that home buyers will consider when buying properties.Infrastructure & Connectivity\nAvailability of good roads, uninterrupted water supply, 24 hours electricity connection and other civic amenities as well as easy connectivity to public transport, railways, bus routes etc.In India, all those home buyers interested in purchasing a new property, Gurugram or Gurgaon offers a lot of options.It is one real estate market which has managed to duck the slump in the real estate sector and has generally been an attractive prospect for home buyers.Some of the best Gurgaon real estate is in areas such as:\nNew Gurgaon – The most coveted address in Gurgaon, a lot of luxurious residential projects as well as commercial projects have come up making it one of the hottest real estate for buyers looking to buy property in Gurgaon.",

This is essential for healthy and balanced community living. • Green homes, or homes that are resource conscious when it comes to energy and water consumption, are increasingly gaining popularity among those who want to invest in homes with a conscience. For example, the design elements of Mahindra Lifespaces’ project ‘Luminare’ include energy-efficient walls and roofs, low-flow water fixtures, solar water heating systems, eco-friendly air-conditioning and STP treated water, all of which also contribute to substantial savings in electricity and water costs for occupants. Solar PV cells and LED lights for common areas, landscapes and amenities, help further reduce utilities expenses. • Look for ready-possession apartments if you want to move in right away.
